## Security

We take security very seriously and are always grateful for reports about potential problems or vulnerabilities.

If you think you have found a security problem in this project, please follow the steps below.

## Reporting a security problem

* Create a new Github issue using the "bug report" template.
* Explain the problem as detailed as possible:
  - What is the type of the problem (SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)?
  - Is any special configuration required to reproduce it?
  - What steps must be taken to reproduce it?
  - How could an attacker exploit the issue?
* Fill in all the remaining information in the template. The more information, the better.
* Finally, add the label "security" to the Github issue.

We look through the open issues regularly and will pick it up ASAP.
